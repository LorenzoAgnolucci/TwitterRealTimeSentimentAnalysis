Lambda Architecture implementation using Apache Storm, Hadoop and HBase to perform Twitter real-time sentinent analysis.

For more information, read the [paper](paper_lambda_architecture_PC.pdf) located in the repo root.

### Built With

* [Apache Hadoop 3.2.1](https://hadoop.apache.org)
* [Apache HBase 2.2.3](https://hbase.apache.org)
* [Apache Storm 2.1.0](https://storm.apache.org)
* [LingPipe 4.1.0](http://alias-i.com/lingpipe)
* [Twitter4J](http://twitter4j.org/en/)



## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites
Apache Storm, Hadoop and HBase installed and correctly configured in your cluster.

## Usage

First you have to get your personal Twitter Developers credentials and write it in a .txt file with the same structure as '''DummyTwitterCredentials'''.

Then start Apache Storm, Hadoop and HBase in your cluster.

Finally execute (in this order):

* '''TwitterSentimentAnalysisTopology.java'''
